# Banking Simulation Program (in progress)

I saw online that a banking program was a good start when it comes to making projects so I decided to try to make one myself.
I also wanted tried to make the UI look nicer.

This project is just my first attempt at using object-oriented programming for something.

## Features
There are six buttons.
1. Create a new account.
2. View all accounts (including balance in each account).
3. Select account (currently selected account is where deposits and withdrawals happen).
4. Deposit money in currently selected account.
5. Withdraw money in currently selected account.
6. Exit program.

User inputs are done at the top half of the program as the prompt indicates. Information and such is displayed in a popup.
