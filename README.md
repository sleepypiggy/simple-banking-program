# Banking Simulation Program (in progress)

I saw online that a banking program was a good start when it comes to making projects so I decided to try to make one myself.
This project is my first attempt at making something using OOP.
I used a little bit of PyQt5 before in Python for GUI previously but I mostly forgot it and I also lost a lot of the work somehow.

## What it is
Simple banking simulation where you can create accounts, deposit money, and withdraw money.

## Features
There are six buttons.
1. Create a new account.
2. View all accounts (including balance in each account).
3. Select account (currently selected account is where deposits and withdrawals happen).
4. Deposit money in currently selected account.
5. Withdraw money in currently selected account.
6. Exit program.

User inputs like amount of money to deposit/withdraw are done at the top half of the program as the prompt indicates. Other information and such is displayed in a popup window.

Note: the buttons have a click down animation in the actual program, the GIF just doesn't have enough frames to show it.
